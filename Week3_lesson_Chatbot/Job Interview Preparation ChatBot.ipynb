    "## Use Case:\n",
    "A Job Interview Preparation Bot that simulates mock interview questions for different job roles (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Marketing Specialist). The bot also gives constructive feedback on answers, suggests improvements, and shares quick interview tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Users**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Students entering the job market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Professionals preparing for interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Career switchers who want to practice in a safe environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Personalized practice without needing a human coach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instant, private, and cost-free preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Builds user confidence through repeated simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cannot fully replace real human interview experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Might not always reflect the latest industry-specific questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback may not be as nuanced as that from an expert recruiter."

    "## Justifying Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the problem is worth solving with a chatbot?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many job seekers lack access to mentors or mock interview coaches. A chatbot provides on-demand, low-cost, and private practice that can significantly improve confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does a chatbot improve the experience compared to a website, app, or human support?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A website/app usually gives static lists of questions, not interactive feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human mock interviews are costly and not always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chatbot allows natural, conversational practice that feels closer to the real experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific tasks the chatbot will perform:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask role-specific interview questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Listen to user’s answers and provide feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give improvement suggestions (tone, clarity, detail).\n",
    "\n",
    "Offer general interview tips (body language, confidence, common mistakes)."

To prevent overfitting, we can use techniques like regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights, or cross-validation, which evaluates the model's performance on unseen data. We can also use early stopping, which stops training the model when its performance on the validation set starts to degrade.\"\n",
