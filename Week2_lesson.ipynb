    "### **Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Stemming:\n",
    "    - Cuts off word endings to get the ‚Äúroot.‚Äù\n",
    "    - Very mechanical ‚Üí may produce non-real words.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - \"studies\" ‚Üí \"studi\"\n",
    "        - \"running\" ‚Üí \"run\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Lemmatization:\n",
    "    - Smarter ‚Üí uses vocabulary + grammar rules.\n",
    "    - Always gives a real word (the **lemma**).\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - \"studies\" ‚Üí \"study\"\n",
    "        - \"running\" ‚Üí \"run\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging means labeling each word in a sentence with its grammatical role ‚Äî like **noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - Sentence ‚Üí *‚ÄúThe cat is sleeping on the mat.‚Äù*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - POS tags ‚Üí\n",
    "        - The ‚Üí Determiner (DT)\n",
    "        - cat ‚Üí Noun (NN)\n",
    "        - is ‚Üí Verb (VBZ)\n",
    "        - sleeping ‚Üí Verb (VBG)\n",
    "        - on ‚Üí Preposition (IN)\n",
    "        - the ‚Üí Determiner (DT)\n",
    "        - mat ‚Üí Noun (NN)\n",
