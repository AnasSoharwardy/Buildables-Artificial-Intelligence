# Youtube Recommendation via Agentic AI
## an AI-Powered YouTube Product Review Analyzer

Just enter a product name, and our system:

- Searches for the top YouTube video reviews  
- Filters out irrelevant videos and content  
- Extracts pros and cons from transcripts  
- Aggregates the insights  
- Gives you a final verdict (Recommended / Not Recommended)  

---

## How It Works (Multi-Agent Pipeline)

This project uses a LangGraph-powered multi-agent workflow to simulate an intelligent decision-making process.

### Agents Involved:

### 1. Product Specificity Checker  
   - Ensures the product query is specific (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy S25" instead of just "Samsung")

### 2. YouTube Search Agent  
   - Fetches top 10 YouTube video IDs using youtube-search-python API

### 3. YouTube Transcript Agent  
   - Extracts the transcript of videos using the YouTubeTranscriptAPI

### 4. Relevance Filter  
   - Uses an LLM (Groq) to filter out unrelated and irrelevant videos

### 5. Transcript Summarizer  
   - Extracts pros & cons from each transcript using LLM prompting

### 6. Verdict Aggregator  
   - Aggregates pros/cons across all videos and generates a final recommendation along with reasoning
